            1. What is Organic Waste?\n
            The definition of organic waste is waste that comes from the
            remains of living creatures, whether animals, plants or humans.
            Basically, this type of waste can decompose naturally in nature
            and can also be used for other things, such as compost and others.\n\n

            2. Wet &amp; Dry Types of Organic Waste\n
            Organic waste can be further divided into two types,
            namely dry and wet organic waste. Types of dry organic waste have little
            to no water content, for example tree branches, dry leaves, bones, etc.
            Wet organic waste has a fairly high water content, making it decompose
            more quickly and can decompose more quickly than dry waste.
            Examples of wet organic waste are leftover vegetables, fruit, etc.\n\n

            3. What are the types of organic waste?\n
            Apart from dry and wet, organic waste is divided into 5 types
            of waste based on its source. The five categories are:\n

            - Food Waste\n
            Organic food waste is generally generated at the household level,
            as well as in food businesses, such as restaurants and cafes.
            The composition includes all types of food and ingredients,
            starting from egg shells, vegetable tubers, fruit peels,
            fish and chicken bones, leftover food, as well as other
            materials that have been consumed or are no longer consumed.
            Food waste also includes cooked food that is not finished or
            consumed, such as rotten fruit and vegetables.\n

            - Garden Waste\n
            Organic waste that comes from gardens is waste whose material
            comes from gardens or yards, such as leaves, trees, twigs
            and grass left over from pruning.\n

            - Agricultural/Farming Waste\n
            Agricultural waste is waste resulting from processing plants,
            such as corn stalks, rice husks and leaves. These agricultural
            residues can usually be processed into compost.\n

            - Livestock waste\n
            Waste from livestock, such as cow and goat dung, is also included in the organic waste category.\n

            - Waste from Body Parts\n
            The body parts in question include nail clippings and fallen human hair as well as fur or skin from animals.
